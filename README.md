Annual Report Assessment Using Large Language Models

Investing fields concerned with stock selection will gain a great deal of insight if they can locate meaningful and relevant information in the entire corpus of annual reports, particularly regarding qualitative aspects of the underlying business. The author of this study assessed Bert and Roberta, two pre-trained language models for this job, and refined their performance on Annual Reports. Using sentence-transformers for classification, the author investigated zero-shot learning and few-shot learning. The findings of the refined language models and additional classifiers are promising and will assist financial analysts in incorporating them into portfolio management and investment decision-making.
